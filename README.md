Grocery Tracker is an app that helps you keep track of the groceries you purchase and the groceries you have at home.

## Features

### Supermarket Tracking üõí

When you go shopping and your shopping cart starts to get crowded, it gets hard to know what you already have, what you are missing and how much you will spend on all of those products. Grocery Tracker makes it simple:

- Set a shopping list for all the products you need.
- Know what you are missing from your shopping list. You will never forget anything again!
- Know how much you will spend at all times. Grocery Tracker scans the products you have and keeps a subtotal at all times.

### Home Tracking üè°

You can set the home monitor system, and it will notify you when you run out of some product, or add it automatically to your shopping list! Grocery Tracker lets you:

- Know what you have in your pantry at all times.
- Notifies you when you run out of a product.
- When you run out of a product, Grocery Tracker can add it automatically to your shopping so you can grab it next time you go to the supermarket.

## Object Detection Model

The heart of the project is an object detection model that recognizes the products. This model was trained using [Edge Impulse](https://edgeimpulse.com), the project is public and can be viewed [here](https://studio.edgeimpulse.com/public/120503/latest).
